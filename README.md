# Seminar-Rosenfeld
* A schedule of sessions is created based upoon the raw total of interest in each session.
* Everyone should get their first choice because first choice session placements happen first (unless more than 32 students are signed up for a given session)
* Overall there were only 90 instances where people were randomly assigned a session they had not asked for (excluding those who did not fill out the form out at all) which averages around 1.2 per student 
* The schedule data is then printed out by student and by session
